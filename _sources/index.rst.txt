Welcome to Open Source HuggingFace Applications's documentation!
================================================================

This documentation covers the topics dicussed in a newly released course by **deeplearning.ai** i.e. `Open Source Models with HuggingFace <https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/open-source-models-hugging-face/>`_. 
I am attempting to present my own perspective and understanding about the topics of the course.

Introduction to HuggingFace
----------------------------

HuggingFace is a one stop place which made open source models by AI community easily accessible. These models can come from different modalities such as 
Speech, Text, Vision, Video, MultiModal etc. We can quickly cascade these models and come up with some useful applications & solve daily problems. 

Course Outline
----------------------------

* Chatbot with opensource LLMs from Meta, Text translations, Capturing semantics using embeddings
* Building Voice assistants, Speech Recognition, Text to Speech, Classification of sounds
* Computer vision, object detection, image segmentation
* Towards cascading models for interesting use cases
* Working with multi modal models
* Using Gradio to deploy our models on HuggingFace Spaces
